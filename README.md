# Arduino & Proteus Simulation Projects

This repository contains various Arduino-based simulation projects developed using Proteus. These projects demonstrate fundamental concepts in electronics, embedded systems, and microcontroller programming. Each project is designed to be simple, educational, and easy to understand for students and hobbyists.

## Projects Included

1. **7-Segment Display Control**
   - Displays numbers from 0–9 using a single or multiple 7-segment displays.
   - Demonstrates the use of digital output and timing functions.

2. **3-Way Traffic Light System**
   - Simulates a traffic light controller for a 3-road junction.
   - Uses timers and LED control to manage red, yellow, and green lights.

3. **LCD Display Interface**
   - Interfacing a 16x2 LCD with Arduino.
   - Displays static or dynamic text messages.

4. **Temperature Sensor**
   - Reads temperature data using an LM35 or DHT11 sensor.
   - Displays the temperature on an LCD or serial monitor.

5. **Robot Control (Using Switches or Joystick)**
   - Simulates basic robotic movement (forward, backward, left, right).
   - Controlled via button switches, joystick, or remote input.

6. **Ultrasonic Sensor-Based Distance Measuring**
   - Uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance.
   - Displays results on an LCD or serial monitor.

7. **Smart Home Simulation**
   - Controls appliances like lights and fans via sensors or GSM.
   - Demonstrates automation and remote control.

## Tools Used

- **Arduino IDE** – for programming the Arduino boards.
- **Proteus Design Suite** – for simulating circuits.
- **C/C++** – as the main programming language for Arduino.

## How to Run

1. Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.
2. Upload it to the Arduino board (or use a virtual board in Proteus).
3. Open the corresponding Proteus `.pdsprj` simulation file.
4. Simulate and observe the output.

## Requirements

- Arduino Uno/Nano/Mega (depending on the project)
- Proteus 8 or later
- Basic electronic components (LEDs, resistors, sensors, motors, etc.)
